We kicked off 2022 with the [OpenUK New Year’s Honours List](https://openuk.uk/2022honourslist/) celebrating future generations of Open Technologists. 
The list is made up of individuals identified as being ones to watch in the UK in Open Source Software, Open Hardware and Open Data. 
All are earmarked as leading the next generation of Open Technology whether through social media, their jobs, community contributions, policy or in education.
