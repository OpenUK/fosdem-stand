Our Learning team has a new Chief Learning Officer, Chris Howard who will work with our Chief Digital Inclusion Officer through 2022 
to continue to develop our work with young people. Both [OpenUK Kids Camps](https://openuk.uk/openkidscamp/) - each a 10 session animated course and ezine - will continue 
to be available under creative commons and we plan to support Key Stage 3 learning of Open Source, the Sustainable Development Goals and 
Digital Skills through these. We will have a further OpenUK digital glove inspired by MiMu give away and run a competition. 

We are also working on an Apprenticeship Scheme Knowledge Module and University Modules for engineering, business and legal and regulatory students.
