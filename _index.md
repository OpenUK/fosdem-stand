  <a id="reports"><h3>State of Open Reports</h3></a>
  
  <p>In 2021, we released the <a href="https://openuk.uk/stateofopen/"><b>State of Open Reports</b></a> in three phases looking at open source software in the UK:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Phase One:</b> Literature Review and Interviews with industry leaders</li>
  <li><b>Phase Two:</b> Quantitative Survey demonstrating uptake across business</li>
  <li><b>Phase Three:</b> Economic Analysis of Value generated by Open Source</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>These reports not only showed that open source software <b>contributed up to £43.15bn to UK GDP</b>, it also highlighted some great use cases including <b>Starling in Phase Two</b> and the <b>energy sector in Phase Three</b>.  We also conducted a survey and the results are in Phase Two. All three reports can be <a href="https://openuk.uk/stateofopen/"><b>read here</b></a>.</p>
  
  <p>For 2022, we will be carrying out work on another three reports:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Open Data</li>
  <li>Open Hardware</li>
  <li>Open Source Software - follow up from 2021</li>
  </ul>
