  <p>With a focus on <b>Skills</b>, <b>Security</b>, and <b>Sustainability</b>, we started 2022 by celebrating the <a href="#honours"><b>New Year’s Honours List</b></a> and launching the ten <a href="#founders"><b>Future Founders Training Sessions</b></a> set up by Matt Barker our Entrepreneur in Residence, and the Founders Forum.  The training sessions are ongoing with the next session happening at <b>12 noon GMT 25th February</b>.  We are also offering a <a href="mentoring"><b>Mentoring Program</b></a> to a small group of UK based individuals.</p>

  <p>And that’s just the beginning. <a href="boards"><b>Security and Sustainability Advisory Boards</b></a> are being created and we welcome involvement from those interested in these areas.  We’re already planning our second <a href="sustainability"><b>Open Technology for Sustainability Day</b></a> and the Third Edition of the <a href="awards"><b>OpenUK Awards</b></a> happening later this year.</p>  

  <p>In <a href="learning"><b>Learning and Skills</b></a>, the Learning Team is growing, continuing to develop the Kids Camp with a further OpenUK digital glove inspired by MiMu give away and competition.</p>

  <p>We are also working on an <b>Apprenticeship Scheme Knowledge Module</b> and <b>University Modules</b> for engineering, business and legal and regulatory students.</p>
